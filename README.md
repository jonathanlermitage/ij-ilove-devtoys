    I Love DevToys
</h1>

An Intellij IDEA (Community and Ultimate) free plugin which is highly inspired from the [DevToys](https://devtoys.app) software available on Windows: Base64, URL and JWT encoders/decoders, UUID, Lorem Ipsum and Hash generators, JSON, YAML, Timestamp converters, Graphics tools... Find these tools in a Tool Window in the top right corner of your IDE.

The global idea is to provide these tools on Linux and macOS (Windows is also supported), because the original DevToys software is available on Windows only.<br/>

**Work in progress**: I am trying to reproduce most of the DevToys features, but it will take some time. Also, contributions are welcome ðŸ˜Ž.    
If you want to support my work, you can consider buying an [Extra Icons](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/11058-extra-icons) plugin license or make a [donation](https://buymeacoff.ee/jlermitage). Thank you! If you already did this, hum... fiesta! ðŸ¥³ (And again, thank you so much!)<br>

## Download

Download plugin from the JetBrains marketplace or via your IDE: <kbd>File</kbd>, <kbd>Settings...</kbd>, <kbd>Plugins</kbd>, <kbd>Marketplace</kbd> then select `I Love DevToys`.

## Build

See [Makefile](./Makefile) file.

## ToDo

* improve the GUI
  * settings: remember last opened tool
  * fix a problem with textarea resizing: when a textarea has a vey long content and the second textarea has only a short text, the resize policy makes one textarea too big, and the other textarea too small. I would like to keep a 50/50 ratio. **Help is welcome**.
* add more tools, like Base64 from file, GZip encoder/decoder, JWT encoder/decoder, HTML escaper, cron parser, timestamp converter, text tools, graphics tools...

Nota: I think we don't need to reproduce tools that exist in IntelliJ already, like the regex tester and markdown previewer.
